   Some useful definitions we used in order to define interpretation
   of primed terms.

(*Used in definition of interpretation of primed terms.*)
(**  Returns the list of variables occurring in the term. **)
Fixpoint term_variables (f : Term) : list KVariable :=
  match f with
  | KTdot _ => []
  | KTfuncOf f _ args => vec_flatten (Vector.map term_variables args)
  | KTnumber r   => []
  | KTread   x   => KVar_of_KAssignable x
  | KTneg    l   =>  term_variables l
  | KTplus   l r => term_variables l ++ term_variables r
  | KTminus  l r => term_variables l ++ term_variables r
  | KTtimes  l r => term_variables l ++ term_variables r
  | KTdifferential theta => term_variables theta
  end.

(** For a given term returns list of variables without duplicates **)
Definition term_variables_nodup (f : Term) : list KVariable :=
  remove_duplicates KVariable_dec (term_variables f).
